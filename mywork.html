WEB AUTHORING<br />
Kieran Blavins - 17636123 | Web Authoring | 10/01/2018 <br />
Introduction<br />
In this report I will be talking about the difference between old and new web standards, and best practices and I will also be covering the strengths and weaknesses of them, and how I incorporated those into my website.

 
Web Standards<br />
Web Standards are a set of guidelines in which we use to develop websites and applications on the web. We do this using development tools and languages such as HTML5 and CSS3.<br />
Perhaps one of the most influential organisations’ involved in web standards development is W3C.
If we are talking about the web, it is difficult to specify a set of guidelines which will apply to its entirety. 
Newer web standards see that it is divided into several categories that communally compose the web.<br />
These categories listed below;<br />
	Web Design and Applications
This is a set of guidelines which cover the creation, maintenance and technologies involved in creating sites and applications it is this section which includes guidelines on how to make your sites and applications more usable to persons with impairments. <br />
	Web of Devices
This is the set of guidelines which cover the use and enabling the use of web technologies on mobile devices.<br />
	Web Architecture 
This is the set of guidelines which focuses on the foundation of the web such as protocols like HTTP and other technologies like URL’s.<br />
	Semantic Web
Semantic web is a broad category which focuses on the support for web technologies and the collection and the use of data on the web. It is also used to help develop other technologies that help us do increasingly useful tasks on the web like the interaction of databases and information, and as we all know the collection and use of data is a very big deal in this industry.<br />
	XML
This is a guideline for the technologies which support the web with security and documentation on the web. Not only this XML technologies also help us with semantic web with XQuery which allows interaction with databases.<br />
	Web Services
Web services is as it sounds it is guidelines which covers services frequented on the web these guidelines are often based on other web technologies like protocols or the likes of XML technologies.<br />
	Browsing and Authoring
This is the set of guidelines which determines that standards and quality of the tools we use to access the web like browser and making sure they all comply to a certain standard use. Such as all browsers should be able to support the latest version of HTML for example.<br />


BEST PRACTICES<br />
Best practices in the web is something every developer should know and have some knowledge of.
Perhaps the most common practice which is pretty standard is the development of a responsive site.
What this means is that when you develop the site you should be developing the site to be used across multiple devices like phone and tablets, but is not enough to just make them work on multiple devices you must be able to provide a good experience to the user no matter how good the device is.<br />

However this isn’t only beneficial to the user it is also beneficial for your site, as doing this also will increase your search engine rankings.
It also means you are future proofing your site against future devices as your site will already be responsive so you will not have to worry about future users not being able to access your site on the go.
Another good practice is to give your sites images meaningful names.
The reason for this is that not only will it mean you know by name the images it will also help improve your SEO through other searches so for example if you had a picture of the statue of liberty, people who then search for that will also potentially come across your site because of that.
If your site is still being developed or if certain pages are still under development, then it is a good practice to hide those pages.<br />
The reason for this is because if users of the site see your underdeveloped page than they may think you are not as skilled as you are, and they may also think that you are not professional.<br />

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES<br />
There are many strengths and weaknesses of current web standards, in this section I will cover a few.
Before I talk about the strengths and weakness of current standards we must thank Jakob Nielsen for creating the 5 principles of usability.<br />

Back in the old days of the web, most sites would be plain with little style and was mostly HTML to make the structure and CSS was embedded as there was very little styling was used.
The strength of this meant that the web was very lightweight and pretty efficient which meant the loading times were not long.<br />
However the weakness of this meant that sites were very long and boring. Which meant that people did not enjoy using sites.<br />

However, newer standards of HTML5 and CSS3 means that now we have a lot of control of how the web page looks.<br />
Perhaps the biggest strength of this is that we are able to make any website look like a thing of beauty!
With JavaScript too, we are able to add such interactivity that we can consider any user which may visit the site and try to customise the site, so it is usable for anyone. And provide a great experience with it.<br />
However, the weakness of newer standards means it can be much more difficult to create the sites we want, this is due to the strictness that we have to comply to such as making sure that persons with impairments’ are able to use the site comfortably, for an example a user with visual impairments may need larger fonts.<br />
Not only that because of how complex the development languages can be it may also take longer to develop the website.
Big and complex sites with lots of features and images may also take longer to load due to other advancements in those technologies also. <br />
